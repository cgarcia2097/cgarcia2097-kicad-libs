# cgarcia2097-kicad-libs
My collection of electronic components drawn in KiCAD. Feel free to use, inspect and contribute to the project.

## What are these used for?
These are mainly drawn by myself for use with the 8pack project. You will need these footprints to open up the 8pack projects. I did not include possibly copyrighted material in the mix, therefore some logos/labels will not render even when these libraries are installed.

I can't think of any way to improve these symbols/footprints any further. And so I turn to you, the reader.

## What do they contain?
A handful of footprints for
* Keyswitches 
* LED strip pads
* Keyswitch cutouts
* Diodes
* Resistors
* MCU boards
