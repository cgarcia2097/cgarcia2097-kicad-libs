# cgarcia2097-kicad-libs
My collection of electronic components drawn in KiCAD. Feel free to inspect and contribute to the project.

# What are these used for?
These are mainly drawn by myself for use with the 8pack project. I can't think of any way to improve these symbols/footprints any further, so I turn to you.
